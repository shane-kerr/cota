Call of the Arena - a roguelike game

This is my first - failed - attempt at a 7-day roguelike, undertaken 
during the 2014 7drl Challenge:

To run the game, use the shell script:

$ ./cota

You play a new gladiator. You only have the very intro scene, without 
any actual opponents.

Explore the interface a bit if you like.

There is a bit of the history of building it at a WordPress blog:
