Christianity was a forbidden faith for hundreds of years in the Roman
Empire. Christians refused to worship the emperor, and the religion
was considered a superstition rather than a true faith - such as the
Judaism from which it originated. Both Jewish and pagan citizens were
hostile to Christians, and used the law to punish them.

Christianity allowed anyone to join, so in principle a Christian
gladiator might have some skill at arms. However, Christian principles
prevented them from defending themselves against other combatants.
Indeed many Christians craved martyrdom in the arena, rather than
fearing death.
