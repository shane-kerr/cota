Germans have lived across the Rhine river from the Roman empire for
centuries. During this time they have periodically raided in small
bands, attacked in force, been invaded by Rome, and peaceably traded
with the settlements and forts along the border.

While a typical barbarian fighting force was no match for a trained
Roman legion, individual Germans can be excellent warriors. They are
favored in the arena for their fierceness - as well as their long
beards which often comes in exotic colors.
