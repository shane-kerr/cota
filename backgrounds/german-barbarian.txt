Germans lived across the Rhine river from the Roman empire for
centuries. During this time they periodically raided in small bands,
attacked in force, were invaded by Rome, and traded with the
settlements and forts along the border.

While a typical barbarian fighting force was no match for a trained
Roman legion, individual Germans could be excellent warriors. They
were favored in the arena for their fierceness - as well as their long
beards which often came in exotic colors.
