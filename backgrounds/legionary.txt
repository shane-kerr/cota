The Roman legionary is a professional soldier of the Roman army. The
main fighting force of a legion is heavy infantry, although legions
also included calvary, archers, and non-combat support units. A
legionary serves for 25 years, during which his life consists of
training, patrolling, as well as helping build ad maintain large
public works like roads and bridges. Individually a legionary is an
expert combatant, as part of a legion he is nearly unbeatable.

Legionaries could end up in the arena for any number of reasons, such
as cowardice, desertion, or disobeying a superior. They are generally
good gladiators, although eventual death in a fight is almost certain.
