welcome

You awaken with a start and a splitting headache. Someone has thrown a
bucket of water in your face. That man - clearly a slave by his
bearing and clothing - steps aside and a tanned, muscled man with gray
hair and more scars than you can count starts to speak.

"Welcome to Iudicatus' Gladiator School, irrumators!"

"Most of you are truly worthless, but it is my job to at least get you
to hold a shield between some Thracian's khopesh and your neck long
enough to entertain the culi paying for the show."

"Some of you may think you know which end of a gladius to poke with.
Some of you may have even survived a fight or two. I don't give a
merda about that. You'll learn to fight here, and fight well, or by
Mars I'll have your colei for my breakfast!"

"Okay, lets see what you can do. Pair up and fight."

With that, the slave wheels a cart filled with wooden swords and
shields out and dumps them on the ground. You stand up, and notice a
handful of other men. They start towards the weapons...
